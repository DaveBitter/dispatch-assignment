# Dispatch Assignment

### introduction
ViriCiti is getting increasingly more involved with smart charging of public transport and other commercial vehicles. For programmers this is highly interesting. In light of these developments we have created a small assignment which will give you some insight into what ViriCiti is actually producing and, of course, help us assessing your programming skills. 

### the assigment


### important points
- Although it is nice if you accomplish to acheive to produce a definite end result, we are more interested in your general approach. This also means that you're javascript does not have to be perfect. 
- Keep things as simple as you possibly can! Only then -- when there is time left -- you can expand and add details.
- We highly value clear code; the easier for us to understand what is going on the better.
- Make sure that you can clarify important decisions and come up with some pros and cons.  
- The initial setup you find here is written in coffeescript. Prefer to write javascript? That's completely fine also.

### possible extras
- Only dispatch the bus with the highest SOC, instead just any bus.
- Instead of adding busses manualy in your code, automise the trail and error process of finding the minimal amount of busses needed to perform the round trips.
- Use the [d3](https://d3js.org/) or [c3](http://c3js.org/) libraries to visualise input and output data.
